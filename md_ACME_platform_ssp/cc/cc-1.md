## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

<!-- Add implementation prose for the main This System component for control: cc-1 -->

#### Implementation Status: planned

### DB

<!-- Add control implementation description here for control: cc-1 -->

#### Rules:

  - db_password_min_length

#### Implementation Status: planned

### IDSERVICE

<!-- Add control implementation description here for control: cc-1 -->

#### Rules:

  - idservice_password_min_length
  - idservice_strong_pass_enabled

#### Implementation Status: planned
